Predict __AVERAGE ANNUAL DAILY TRUCK TRAFFIC__ from counts in satellite images  
1. Fast-RCNN/SSD to detect truck  
2. Road filter: geospatial data  
_We only want to count trucks that are driving a specific road
of interest, and exclude those that are sitting in parking lots or traveling on
other nearby roads. To filter out irrelevant predictions from the detection
model, we use geospatial data. Those data are ubiquitous, and also available
for main transit highways in developing countries. We count a truck if at least
one corner of its bounding box is within a certain distance of the center of
the road. If both lanes are indicated, we set this distance to 8 meters, which
approximately accommodates a four-lane highway. This filter is applied to
both the ground truth validation and test datasets and the predictions from
the model._
3. Traffic monitoring model  
![Procedure](https://github.com/ReehcQ/satellite/blob/master/imgs/truck%20monitor%20process.png)

#### Method
data:  
+ resolution: 31cm  
  
detection:  
+ SSD/Faster R-CNN ResNet50/101  
+ prediction error
+ geospatical data (parking trucks) -- __shapefile__

count:  
+ highway toll/census (for validation?)  
+ vehicle speeds, section length  

monitoring:  
+ parameters
  - vehicle counts c
  - constant speed v
  - section length s
  - traffic density variation factor f
+ Uncertainty analysis: Monte Carlo
