## Introduction

## Challenges
### Satellite images
1. __Sampling__: the objects are too small (vehicles are about 10 pixels) and gathered in the images, which have extremely high resolution
2. __Annotated Dataset__: lack of high-quality training data  

How YOLT address sampling limitation compared with YOLO?
